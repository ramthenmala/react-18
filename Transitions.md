# Transitions

 A transition is a new concept in React to distinguish between urgent and non-urgent updates.

 - Urgent updates are the ones that reflect direct interaction, like typing, clicking, pressing, and so on.

- Transition updates transition the UI from one view to another in a non-urgent manner.
